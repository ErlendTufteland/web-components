# Web Components Design System

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a versatile and easily adaptable design system using Web Components. The core philosophy of this design system is to enable rapid customization across any project by modifying just a few CSS variables. Each component in this system utilizes these shared theme CSS variables, ensuring a consistent look and feel while offering the flexibility to tailor the design to different needs and branding guidelines.

## Features

- **Reusable Components**: A collection of Web Components that can be reused across various web projects.
- **Customizable Design**: A central theme file with CSS variables allows for easy customization of the entire design system.
- **Consistent Look and Feel**: Uniformity across components ensures a cohesive user interface.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Optimized for performance and speed, enhancing the user experience.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed to be easily integrated into existing projects with minimal setup.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system to use the project's build tools and dependencies.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/crypticlon/web-components.git
   cd web-components
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start a local server, usually on `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **Build for Production**

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

   This command generates the `dist` directory with production-ready files.

### Customizing the Design

To customize the design system:

1. Open the `src/theme.css` file.
2. Modify the CSS variables to suit your project's design requirements.
3. The changes will be reflected across all components that use these variables.

## Components

List and describe the available components in your design system. For example:

- **s-button**: A customizable button component.
- **s-card**: A flexible card component for displaying content.
- ... _other components_ ...
