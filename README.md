# Web Components Design System

## Disclaimer

Please note that this project is currently a work in progress and not yet completed. It is actively being developed, and as such, features, components, and documentation are subject to change. This project may not be fully functional or stable until its development reaches a more mature stage. Users and contributors should be aware that using this design system in its current state might involve encountering incomplete features or potential issues. Feedback and contributions are welcome to help drive the project towards completion.

## Overview

This project focuses on creating a versatile and easily adaptable design system using Web Components. The core philosophy of this design system is to enable rapid customization across any project by modifying just a few CSS variables. Each component in this system utilizes these shared theme CSS variables, ensuring a consistent look and feel while offering the flexibility to tailor the design to different needs and branding guidelines.

## Features

- **Reusable Components**: A collection of Web Components that can be reused across various web projects.
- **Customizable Design**: A central theme file with CSS variables allows for easy customization of the entire design system.
- **Consistent Look and Feel**: Uniformity across components ensures a cohesive user interface.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: Optimized for performance and speed, enhancing the user experience.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed to be easily integrated into existing projects with minimal setup.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system to use the project's build tools and dependencies.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/crypticlon/web-components.git
   cd web-components
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the Development Server**

   ```sh
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start a local server, usually on `http://localhost:3000`.

4. **Build for Production**

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

   This command generates the `dist` directory with production-ready files.

### Customizing the Design

To customize the design system:

1. Open the `src/theme.css` file.
2. Modify the CSS variables to suit your project's design requirements.
3. The changes will be reflected across all components that use these variables.
